                Liverpool Football Club /ˈlɪvərpuːl/ is a Premier League football club based in Liverpool. Liverpool
                F.C. is one of the most successful clubs in England and has won more European trophies than any other
                English team with five European Cups, three UEFA Cups and three UEFA Super Cups. The club has also won
                eighteen League titles, seven FA Cups and a record eight League Cups. In spite of their successful
                history, Liverpool are yet to win a Premier League title since its inception in 1992.\r\n\r\nLiverpool
                was founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the following year. The club has played at Anfield
                since its formation. The most successful period in Liverpool's history was the 1970s and '80s when Bill
                Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to eleven league titles and seven European trophies.\r\n\r\nThe
                club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster
                in 1985, during which charging Liverpool fans caused a crush that resulted in a wall collapsing and the
                death of 39 Juventus supporters, after which English clubs were banned from European competition for
                five years. In the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush
                against perimeter fencing.\r\n\r\nLiverpool has long-standing rivalries with neighbours Everton and with
                Manchester United. The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964.
                The club's anthem is \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".
